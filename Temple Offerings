/* Consider a devotee wishing to give offerings to temples along a mountain range. The temples are located in a row at different heights.
Devotee is very religious and wants to offer each temple at least one offering. If two adjacent temples are at different altitudes, then 
the temple that is higher up should receive more offerings than the one that is lower down. If two adjacent temples are at the same height
, then their offerings relative to each other does not matter. Find the minimum number of offerings to bring. */
